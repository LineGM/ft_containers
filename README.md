## About the project

> _In this project, we must reimplement some of the STL containers, defined by the ISO 1998._

Here are the specificities of the five containers

	Vector: a dynamic array that allows insertion at the end of the container. Elements can be easily access thanks with the corresponding index.
 
 	List: a circular linked list (with a neutral node linking beginning and end of the list). Better than vector for inserting or deleting elements.
  
  	Stack: a container adaptator (LIFO, last in first out).
   
   	Queue: a container adaptator (FIFO, first in first out).
    
    Map: a sorted container using an AVL binary tree (auto-equilibrates itself to optimize the time to find a value in the tree), in order to store the datas like in a dictionnary (a key associated to its value).

For more detailed information: [**subject**](https://github.com/LineGM/ft_containers/blob/main/ft_containers_en.pdf).

## Usage

### Requirements

The functions is written in C++ language and thus needs the **`c++` compiler** to run.

### Instructions

**Compiling**

To compile run:

```shell
$ make ...
```
